# Frontend Test
####by Logan Wu 2016
5 major fixes:
1. On the landing page: fix the misalignment of the countdown clock, justify your trip, and Agenda Builder Now Live section.

2. On the Landing page, under the top 5 reasons to attend.  Make it so the Executive Networking & Collaboration accordion is expanded on page load.  Also, collapse the Leadership In Innovation section on page load.

3. On the Expo Page, for the Providing compelling business Justification for Partnership section, swap the positions of the text and the images. How can you do it without physically moving the HTML?

4. On the Event Details page: The left navigation seems to be highlighting the wrong section when scrolling down the page. Please fix this.

5. On the Sponsors Page: make it so when I click on the ‘Click Here for a List of Current Sponsors’ it will move me down the page to the section with the tabs, and switch me to the Current Sponsors tab.
