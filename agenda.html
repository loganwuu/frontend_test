                        <p>
                          Francois Pienaar reached the highest peak in rugby union when, in 1995 he captained his country, South Africa, to World Cup victory on home turf and was presented the Webb Ellis Trophy by President, Nelson Mandela.  He is acknowledged as an inspiring leader with an uncompromising approach to commitment and we are delighted that Francois will be joining us at TEAM Polycom to speak about leadership, courage and teamwork.
                        </p>
						            <p>
                        The film 'Invictus' a Clint Eastwood-directed production depicts Francois's story.
