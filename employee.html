This will cut down on wait times, provide consistent implementation of the travel policy and allow us to track our attendees for safety and security purposes. </p>
                        <p>In North America, you will be provided a link to book your flights on a special GetThere link that works with our TEAM Polycom Group Travel Desk. It will look very similar to the way you typically book flights using Polycom’s online booking tool. Additional information and training sessions on how to book your flights will be sent out prior to the deadline of January 7, 2014.</p>
                        <p>Outside of North America, you will see a place to request your travel during the registration process. A travel agent from the TEAM Polycom Group Travel Desk will contact you to confirm your flight options and book your flights for you.</p>

                        <p>Please be careful when booking flights to avoid unnecessary expenses. Once a ticket is issued, no changes are permitted without leadership approval as defined in the approval section in order to avoid expensive airline change fees.

Should the employee make a change directly with the airline, they will then be responsible for the entire cost of the ticket.</p>

                          <p>The Global Travel Policy allows for frequent flyer membership upgrades, only if there is no additional cost to the company. These upgrades should be booked directly with the airline only after being ticketed by Polycom Travel. Most airlines require booking/ticketing at a higher fare in order to have a chance to get upgraded which is not guaranteed. Make sure you review your options before your ticket is approved and issued, no changes will be permitted after the ticketing. Employees are not allowed to book themselves at a higher fare in order to use frequent flyer upgrade privileges when a lower fare exists. You may add upgrade seats, but you may not change the ticket because Polycom loses control of the ticket and we can no longer assist you, or locate you in case of an emergency.

                          <p>If you have any last minute changes that will prevent your attendance, please notify your Sales Operations Representative as defined in the approval section, your travel agent and our Conference Registration Department at +1 (800) 483-2970 (domestic) or +1 (971) 223-0773 (international) Monday to Thursday from 6:00 a.m. to 5:00 p.m. and Friday from 6:00 a.m. to 3:00 p.m. U.S. Pacific Time zone or email <a href="mailto:registration@TEAMpolycom2014.com">registration@TEAMpolycom2014.com</a> as soon as possible. Note: It is important that you contact both representatives since cancellation of a flight will not automatically cancel your hotel room. Flight cancellations that are not processed prior to departure time cannot be used towards a future flight. </p>

                        <h4 class="red-text">Trip Extensions for Personal Reasons</h4>
                          <p>Any extension of your visit to TEAM Polycom for personal reasons beyond the dates listed above must be disclosed upfront and pre-approved prior to ticketing, even if the cost is the same or you are making your own hotel reservations. In order to obtain approval, you will need to follow these steps:</p>

                          <ol class="listPadding">
                            <li>Have approved PTO, if the extension includes a work day </li>
                            <li>Employees must ask a travel agent from the TEAM Polycom Group Travel Desk to provide a comparison of the flight costs between the normal lowest logical fare over the original dates and the flight with the personal portion included.</li>
                            <li>Employees should then send an email request to <a href="mailto:alla.neys@polycom.com" target="_blank">Alla Neys</a> in Corporate Travel for personal travel approval, with the comparison attached.</li>
                            <li>Alla will provide you and the travel agency with the approval and payment process for your region prior to ticketing. If approval is not obtained prior to ticketing, the employee will be responsible for the cost of the airline ticket.</li>
                            <li>Any additional flight costs for adding a personal extension in Vancouver will be collected via credit card when the ticket is issued. The ticket is not changeable or refundable once ticketed. Any additional expenses for the personal portion of the trip, including transportation, meals and hotel stays, will be paid by the employee based on policies for their region.</li>
                            <li>
                            <p>A Saturday night stay, in some instances (mostly on international trips), can produce significant savings. Polycom will reimburse the cost of the room, tax, and meals if the total does not exceed 50% of the amount saved.</p>
                              <ul>
                                <li>Personal activities (tours, sightseeing) are not reimbursable</li>
                                <li>The traveler is to stay at the hotel within the same price range and room type</li>
                                <li>Proper documentation and pre-approval from Corporate Travel must be attached to the expense report</li>
                              </ul>
                            </li>
                          </ol>

                          <p>Note that changing flights directly through the airline (even if you pay for your own change fee) is not permitted because Polycom loses control of the ticket and we can no longer assist you, or locate you in case of an emergency. Should the employee make a change directly with the airline, they will then be responsible for the entire cost of the ticket.</p>

                          <p><strong><em>Although extensions in Vancouver are permitted, side trips to other cities are not permitted along the trip.</em></strong></p>
