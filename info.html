In 2014 we are establishing a Global Delegate fee that is consistent across theatres and represents an equitable approach to participants.  This is in recognition of our Partners commitment to attend this key event and contribution to its success.  To achieve this global price, Polycom is using Joint Marketing Funds to subsidize the difference between the event cost and the partner delegate fees below.  You will observe the delegate fee for <span class="all-caps">TEAM</span> Polycom 2014 is lower than the delegate fee in 2013.

                          Get a data and long distance plan before leaving home. Are you one of many of convention attendees traveling from the U.S. or internationally into Canada? Take Note: Roaming charges and data plan fees for cell phones (especially smart phones like the iPhone or the Android) and tablets like the iPad can be costly, with prices spiking as high as several dollars per minute. Before catching your flight to Canada, contact your local cell phone carrier to get information about special pricing plans for calls, text messaging and Internet usage outside your home country. If you use a smart phone, ask your carrier about certain settings such as "airplane mode" that may help you save money on usage.
