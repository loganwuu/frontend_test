                    <h3>Your Information is Protected</h3>

                    <p>When visiting this site, you may be asked to provide us with some personal information. This information is used solely for the purpose of making your future visits easier and for purposes of security. It enables us to store key details, such as your name, address, program status, etc., so you don't have to enter the same information each time you enter this site.</p>

                    <h3>Non-Individually Identifiable Information Collected Automatically</h3>

                    <p>In some cases, we may collect information about you that is not individually identifiable. Examples of this type of information include the type of Internet browser you are using or the type of computer operating system you are using.</p>

                    <h3>About Cookies</h3>

                    <p>Many websites, including this site, use cookie technology to help users navigate efficiently. When you make selections or set preferences on our site, our site will send a request to your web browser to record some (but not all) of your selections in a "cookie" file. The cookie is a small text file that resides on your hard drive. From time-to-time, our site will request the cookie from your browser so that we can retrieve the stored information and you do not have to make the same selections over and over again.</p>

                    <p>We never use cookies to store personal information, such as passwords or credit card numbers, nor can the information we store in the cookie ever be read by any website other than ours.</p>

                    <p>Please Note: With most browsers, a user can set the preferences to show a warning each time a cookie request is received. You can also usually set the browser not to accept cookies at all. However, doing so will require you to enter similar data each time you visit this site.</p>

                    <h3>Security Policy</h3>

                    <p>When you are asked for confidential account information, we will require that a secure "session" first be established using Secure Socket Layer (SSL). Before this data is transmitted, our site will first establish a secure "session" using SSL. This technology encodes information as it is being sent over the Internet between your computer and our secure servers, helping to ensure that the information remains confidential.</p>

                    <p>You will know when a secure "session" is taking place, because your browser will display an indicator of whether your session is secure or not. For example, a broken key symbol may appear in the bottom bar to indicate you are visiting an insecure site; an unbroken key will indicate a secure site. You should see an unbroken key during each visit to this site.</p>

                    <h3>Amendments</h3>

                    <strong>TEAM Polycom Registration Headquarters</strong> and <strong>ITA</strong><em>Group</em>, Inc. may amend this policy from time to time.

                    <h2>Opus Events Agency Privacy Policy</h2>
            <p>
              Opus Events Agency (“Opus”) respects the privacy of individuals who may choose to provide their personal information to us. We recognize the need for appropriate protections and management of personal information that you provide to us. This Privacy Statement will assist you in understanding what types of information we may collect, how that information may be used, and with whom the information may be shared.
            </p>
            <p>
              This Privacy Statement applies to information collected by Opus Events Agency through websites that display or link to this statement.
            </p>

            <h3>Purpose</h3>
            <p>
              Opus Events Agency collects and uses personal information to provide our clients with the services they have contracted us to execute, and to provide you with the ability to take part in said services. Specifically, we use your information to help you complete a transaction or order, to deliver products and services to you, to bill you for products or services you purchased, and to provide ongoing service and support. Occasionally we may use your information to contact you in the case of an issue with your use of our services.
            </p>
            <h3>Choice and consent</h3>
            <p>
              Your decision to provide personal information through our websites is voluntary. If you do not provide the personal information requested, however, you may not be able to proceed with the activity or receive the benefit for which the personal information is being requested.
              You can always unsubscribe or choose not to receive communications from us by following the specific instructions in the email you receive or by notifying us as provided below.
              If information that was previously collected is to be used for purposes not previously identified in the privacy notice, or if new information is collected, the new purpose will be documented, you will be notified and your consent for this use of information will be sought.
            </p>
            <h3>Collection</h3>
            <p>
              Opus Events Agency gathers two types of information from its site users: Data that users provide through voluntary registration on our sites, and non-personally identifiable and anonymous “aggregate Information” which we gather through existing web technologies. Such data may include IP address, browser type and version, operating system, and domain name. This data is used to tally page views as well as to gather demographic information about users of our sites.
            </p>
            <h3>Cookies</h3>
            <p>
              Opus also uses cookies on its websites. Cookies are identifiers that can be sent from a website via your browser to be placed on your computer's hard drive. Thereafter as you navigate the website, a message is sent back to the web server by the browser accessing the website.
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Session Cookies: Some cookies operate from the time you visit a website to the end of that particular web-browsing session.  These cookies expire and are automatically deleted when you close your internet browser. These cookies are called “session” cookies. Opus uses only session cookies on its registration websites.</li>

              <li>Persistent cookies: Some cookies will stay on your device between browsing sessions – they do not expire when you close your browser.  These cookies are called “persistent” cookies.  The length of time a persistent cookie stays on your device varies from cookie to cookie. Opus uses persistent cookies on Agenda Builder and the ERC to be able to allow visitors to automatically log into those applications.</li>

              <li>Right to reject cookies: You may elect not to accept cookies by changing the designated settings on your web browser. However, not utilizing cookies may prevent you from using certain functions and features of websites.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Use and retention</h3>
            <p>
              Opus will retain your personal information only for as long as it is needed to provide you services. If you wish to request that we no longer use your personal information to provide you services, contact us as provided below. We will retain, use and disclose your information as necessary to comply with our legal, ethical or document retention obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, and any request to delete personal information is subject to these obligations.
            </p>
            <p>
              Personal information of our clients’ customers
              Opus Events Agency may share personal information with our clients or suppliers to the extent needed to deliver a product or service otherwise enable a business transaction. Opus may also process personal information about our clients’ customers on their behalf when providing services to our clients.
              In these situations it is our clients rather than we who decide the reasons for which the original information will be processed. For details of how this information will be used and protected, please refer to the privacy policy of the Opus client on whose behalf you submitted your personal information. A link to this policy will be provided where pertinent. 
            </p>
            <h3>Disclosure to third parties</h3>
            <p>
              Third party service providers and suppliers receiving personal information are expected to apply privacy and security protection that is consistent with this Privacy Statement. These companies are authorized to use your personal information only for the purpose it was originally intended or as required or permitted by law. Unless otherwise dictated by law or agreement, Opus is not responsible for any improper use by such parties; however, Opus will take remedial action in response to misuse of personal information by a third party to whom such information has been transferred.
            </p>
            <p>
              Opus may also disclose personal information and the content of communications in order to: (a) comply with the law or respond to lawful requests or legal process; or (b) act in good faith to protect the rights or property of our business, employees, suppliers or customers.
            </p>
            <h3>Security</h3>
            <p>
              Opus is committed to taking reasonable efforts to secure the personal information you choose to provide us. To protect the privacy of any personal information you may have provided, Opus employs Internet firewalls, intrusion detection, anti-virus protection, and network monitoring, and, where appropriate and required by applicable law, Secure Socket Layer (SSL) or similar network encryption. If a password is used to help protect your accounts and personal information, it is your responsibility to keep your password confidential.
            </p>
            <h3>Quality and Access</h3>
            <p>
              Opus Events Agency strives to keep your personal information accurate. We have implemented technology, management processes and policies to maintain data integrity. However, though we have implemented these steps, you are responsible for ensuring the accuracy of your personal information when you provide it to us.
            </p>
            <p>
              We will provide you with access to your information when reasonable, or in accordance with relevant laws, including making reasonable effort to provide you with online access and the opportunity to change your information. To protect your privacy and security, we will take steps to verify your identity before granting access or making changes to your personal information. To access and/or correct information, you can do so online or notify us as provided below.
            </p>
            <h3>Links to non-Opus websites</h3>
            <p>
              Opus websites may provide links to third-party websites for your convenience and information. If you access those links, you will leave the Opus website. Opus Solutions does not control those sites or their privacy practices, which may differ from ours. We do not endorse or make any representations about third-party websites. The personal information you choose to give to unrelated third parties is not covered by this Privacy Statement. We encourage you to review the privacy policy of any company before submitting your personal information.
            </p>

            <p>
